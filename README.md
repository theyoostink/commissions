# commissions

## Intro

This is a webpage for my art commissions. Check it out! [https://theyoostink.github.io/commissions/](https://theyoostink.github.io/commissions/)

## Customization

I made this website from scratch, but I designed the code so that it can be used as a template by anyone who wants to copy it and customize to make it their own. You just need some working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with Bootstrap and jQuery.

Files to modify:

- `index.html` (content of the About Me modal, social links, titles, etc.)
- `css/styles.css` (the colors and fonts and other styles)
- `js/script.js` (translateWord function will map tag names to a fancier display string in the filter menu)
- `js/data.js` (the JSON data about the commissions themselves)

You can then deploy the website for free with GitHub Pages, but it will use a `github.io` domain. You can also buy your own domain name and have it point to this site. Look up instructions online.

Image hosting should be done on another site or app. GitHub has size limits for the overall repository and for individual files. For ease of use, images should be hosted on a site like imgur, catbox.moe, or Discord that will provide a URL for the hosted image's location. That URL should be used to populate `data.js` fields.
